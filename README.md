Indian Online Fraud Detection Analysis (Tableau Dashboard)
📝 Overview
This repository hosts an in-depth data visualization project focused on analyzing and identifying key trends, patterns, and risk factors associated with online financial fraud in India. The core of this project is a dynamic Tableau dashboard that processes transaction data to provide actionable insights for developing robust fraud prevention strategies.

The analysis is based on a dataset of 7,478 total transactions, from which 676 fraudulent transactions were identified.

📊 Key Findings & Dashboard Insights
The Tableau dashboard highlights several critical areas for fraud mitigation:

1. High-Risk Fraud Types
Payment Card Fraud is the most dominant type of fraud observed.
Phishing is also a significant contributor to the total fraud count.
2. Card Type Vulnerability
Visa and MasterCard transactions show the highest count of fraudulent activity, requiring increased scrutiny.
Rupay transactions appear to have the lowest fraud count in the analyzed data.
3. Geographical Hotspots
Major metropolitan areas are the primary centers for transaction volume and fraud activity: New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, and Hyderabad.
Filtering to Bangalore specifically shows 372 fraudulent transactions totaling ₹1,784,341.
4. Temporal Trends
Fraudulent transactions exhibit notable seasonal peaks, particularly in the months of March and September.
Activity is lower in January, May, and late in the year (November/December).
5. High-Value Risks
Specific High-Risk Merchants and certain customer age groups (e.g., bin 6,213) are associated with transactions that have a higher average monetary value.
